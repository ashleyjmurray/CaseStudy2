# CaseStudy2


Questions:

1. Should we combine the data between people into one, or should we create a model separately for each person and combine later?

2. Initial ideas: what are some ideas of models?

3. What ideas for approaching the missing data (probably MICE method that was described in the video --> there's an R package for that so that might be useful to start at)
