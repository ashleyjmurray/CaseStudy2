1. Run the following command to get the correct Python version on your cluster:

    module load Python/3.8.1
    
2. Create a virtual environment:
    
    virtualenv env
    
3. Activate your virtual environment:

    source env/bin/activate

4. Install the necessary packages by running the command:

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    
5. Run this command (xgboost doesn't work unless you run this in this way):

    python3 -m pip install xgboost
    
6. Submit the job:

    sbatch submit_job.sh

This will result in the calculated models and also "final.csv" in your directory. final.csv is the result of feature extraction for the windows created from the
raw sensor data. You will you final.csv for part (iii), calculating the heterogenity. This can be completed in the following steps:

1. Submit the job:

    sbatch submit_r_job.sh
    
2. Run cat-slurm-job#.out in your terminal after it finishes running. You should be able to see the summary of the logistic model testing heterogenity as described in 
the .PDF document. 

For the other two reproducibility tasks: 

1. After submit_job.sh runs, classification accuracy for the first goal is outputted in the file "model_results_all.csv". Each row gives the CV accuracy and F1 score for each model, trained on all the data.

2. Classification accuracy for the fourth goal is outputted in the file "model_results_wrist_only.csv".
